# dwc-test

ðŸ§ª This repository is a test space for testing Darwin Core (DwC) terms and data publication. 
Are you not sure how some DwC fields are well interpreted by the IPT while publishing the dataset on GBIF? 
This is THE place to make your tests  Create your dummy test files, e.g. `taxon.csv` and `distribution.csv` in `./data`. 
Thanks to the INBO's test IPT we can check how the contect of these files will look alike as a dataset on the IPT.
